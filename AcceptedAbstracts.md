### Investigations into a Global Digitisation Dataset

During 2019 a network of libraries from the UK and US were funded by the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council under their Collaborations in Digital Scholarship programme to investigate the creation of a global dataset of all digitised texts^1 via prototyping and community engagement. This work was led by the University of Glasgow, with HathiTrust, the National Library of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, the British Library, and Research Libraries UK.

### Digital history and the politics of digitization

Much has been, and is, made of the transformative potential of digital resources and ‘data’ for humanities’ and historical research. Historians are flooded with digital and digitized materials and tend to take them for granted, grateful for the opportunities they afford. As the late Roy Rosenzweig observed in 2003, historians “may be facing a fundamental paradigm shift from a culture of scarcity to a culture of abundance”(Rosenzweig, 2003: 739). Yet, if we accept that we do indeed live in a culture of abundance, that abundance is still rarely questioned and qualified, let alone contextualized in time and space. To put it simply: the question of why, where and how we can access what we can access is rarely posed.
