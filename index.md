# Digitales Archiv und Kanon

Die frühe Kanondebatte hat in den 1970er Jahren die grundlegende Frage gestellt, wessen Werke eigentlich publiziert, rezensiert und damit potentiell kanonisiert werden. Aktualisiert muss diese Frage heute lauten, wessen Werke und welche Objekte in welcher Form wie digitalisiert werden – die ‚Kanonfrage 2.0‘.

Am 10.3.21 wird das zweite Maximilian-Bockhoff-Kolloquium stattfinden, das unter dem Thema "Digitales Archiv und Kanon" steht. Das Programm dazu finden Sie hier. 
Das virtuelle Kolloquium zielt auf Austausch und versteht sich als Einladung, diese Frage aus unterschiedlichen Blickwinkeln zu reflektieren, um sich auf interdisziplinärer Ebene der Problematik zu stellen.

# Digital Archive and Canon

The ongoing digitalisation work by libraries, archives, and museums has led to a massive growth in their digital holdings. The result is not a single, digital archive, but multiple, with every digitising institution creating and making accessible their own digital archive. This trend has benefited both academics undertaking archival research, but also the wider public, particularly considering the current situation where physical access to libraries and some of their holdings is restricted due to hygiene and travel restrictions.

The massive growth of these digital archives has enabled access to such a wide range of content, that it has become impossible for a single person to view all of it. On one hand this is a positive development, as nothing is hidden behind physical barriers and the cultural memory becomes individualised (Abigail De Kosnik). On the other hand, a re-consolidation towards a small canon can be observed (Stefan Neuhaus), as the massive scale of available data is met with  return to the well-known and familiar.

The canon debate of the 1970s asked the fundamental question of which authors’ works are published, reviewed, and thus available for canonisation. Today this question needs to be rephrased to ask which author’s works and which objects are digitised in what form,  the “canon question 2.0”.

The virtual colloquium sees itself as a venue to promote the exchange of ideas and as an invitation to reflect on this question from a range of interdisciplinary standpoints. The aim is to make the selection processes explicit and transparent, to consider how they are undertaken, which criteria are involved in the selection for digitisation and the presentation of digitalisation results, and what gaps this may produce. Potential topics to discuss include, but are not limited to:

* What is digitised and where is there a digital gap, that may remain for some time? How is the process structured, prioritised, and how are decisions made? Which criteria are applied when making decisions?
* What effect does the (missing) digitisation have on the works of already forgotten, marginalised, or otherwise non-canonised authors, artists, time-periods, genres, or objects in general? Is the digitisation process improving knowledge of and about these or are they being forgotten and marginalised even more, as they are not digitised? What is the effect of research funding on this process?
* Which digitised objects are easily findable and visible? Under what license and for whom are they freely accessible? Are digital barriers being added to replace the physical barriers that have been removed?
* What consequences does the digitisation process have for the “traditional canon”? What is the relationship between this canon and the digital archive? Is the digitalisation consolidating or critically engaging with the canon?
