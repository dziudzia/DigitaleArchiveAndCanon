## Fragmentierung des Archivs für die Kreativität: Entwicklung digitaler Samplepacks mit Sounds indischer Musikinstrumente

Dieser Vortrag dreht sich um die Zusammenstellung digitaler Samplepacks aus dem Instruments INDIA Soundarchiv mit dem Ziel kommerzieler Nutzung. Das Instruments INDIA Archiv wurde 2013 eröffnet und enthält über 5 Stunden an Soundaufnahmen Indischer Musikinstrumente, welche aus einer Kollaboration zwischen den Forscher_innen und Milap (die führende Indischer Kulturentwicklungsorganisation im Vereinigten Königreich) entstanden sind. Diese digitale Resource wurde erstellt, um Musikbildungsinitiativen zu unterstützen (über die Webseite und als herunterladbare Tabletapp) und um die Bekanntheit klassischer, indischer Musikaufführungen im Vereinigten Königreich zu erweitern.

## Fragmenting the archive for creativity: developing digital sample packs of Indian musical instrument sounds

This presentation will discuss the process of curating digital sample packs for commercial distribution from the larger Instruments INDIA sound archive. The Instruments INDIA archive was established in 2013 and contains over 5 hours of sound recordings of Indian musical instruments stemming from a collaboration between the researcher and Milap (the UK’s leading Indian Arts Development Trust). This digital resource was created to support music education initiatives (in website and downloadable tablet form) and to enhance audience development for Indian classical music performances in the UK.

### Key points

* The Instruments INDIA sound archive established in 2013 contains approximately five hours of sound recordings of approximately 28 different Indian musical instruments. These sound recordings were conducted as part of a collaborative research project between Dr Manuella Blackburn and Milap (the UK’s leading Indian Arts Development Trust) in 2012 to assist in educational work, website dissemination and to inform concert goers about the world of Indian classical music. The sounds were also integrated into a series of experimental electronic works exploring the position of culturally diverse materials in new contexts.
* The archive has remained mostly inaccessible to public users, apart from sound bites available on the Instruments INDIA website: https://www.milapfest.com/instruments-india/ The process to scale up dissemination and access to the archive in the form of sample pack development has been funded this year through an AHRC ED&I fellowship (entitled: ‘Overcoming Sonic Stalemates: Representing Cultural Diversity in Sample Packs’). Moving from the archive to commercial sample packs is a means to offer sound materials to global end users working in music production. The intention is to work with the contributing musicians appearing in the archive to curate samples (one-shot and loops) from the existing sound recordings.
* There are several ambitions in undertaking this activity; firstly we acknowledge a gap in market for high quality sample pack provision on existing sample pack distribution sites. Those that are available often present problematic issues with crediting the artists, representation of diversity and tend to fall into stereotyped notions of what is perceived as Indian musical instruments, rarely straying beyond sitar and table provisions. Secondly, we want to observe the practice of sample pack curation (sifting, selecting, formatting and distributing) to better this fast growing and popular industry of commercial sample pack creation and purchase. These improvements are mainly with regards to diverse sound materials and the representation of culturally diverse content, as well as the position of artists and their sound products. Sample pack distribution platforms all deal with this differently and we have started to see signs of good practice versus practices that are less desirable.
* Our process of engaging in dialogue with musicians for this purpose has started to reveal important considerations for the sound archive. The paper discusses these conversations that include the formatting conventions (retiming or ‘correcting’ rhythms for DAW use), application of subtle effects (reverb, EQ, compression and normalised (-6dB) to conform to a set dynamic level changes) to ‘touch up’ sound materials ready for producers to use in their creations.
* As we look back on the sound archive and reflect on decisions for its initial curation, we notice its achievements in capturing a number of rare, folk and devotional instruments that are seldom heard outside of India. We recognise the vast diversity in playing styles via the capture of world-renowned musicians and those at the start of their performing careers. We know that the intended sample packs are not able to stand for the entirety of all Indian musical instruments, but instead will provide a snapshot of creative talent packaged in a new form to further new creativity, not limited to one style, but areas as wide as DIY bedroom producing, EDM, pop, hip-hop and experimental work.
